# colour-solid-maze
The unacceptable face of a wee text-adventure game

A text-adventure, where the player tries to escape from a maze. The colour-themes of the rooms and their locations form a discrete representation of a colour-solid.

The baseline-code from which this game was developed was provided by Aalto University (Helsinki, Finland) to students on the Scala-programming course: Ohjelmointi 1, in the autumn of 2015.

This repository only shows the front-end components used to convert the original JVM-Scala version of the game into a Scala.js version.
